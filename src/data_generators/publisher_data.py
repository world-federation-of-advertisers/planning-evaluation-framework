class PublisherData:
    """Real or simulated impression log data for a single publisher.

    PublisherData represents a viewing log for a single publisher.
    It can be thought of as a sequence of events of the form (id, spend),
    where id is the (virtual) id of a user, and spend is the total spend
    amount that would cause this impression to be shown.

    A PublisherData object can be constructed in one of several ways:
      1. It can be constructed directly from a list of (id, spend) tuples.
      2. It can be read from a flat file.
      3. It can be generated randomly.

    In the last case, e.g. random generation, the generation of the publisher
    data is divided into two steps, which are orthogonal to each other.
    In the first step, the sequence of id's is generated, with multiplicities.
    In the second step, spend information is associated to the id's.  Thus,
    to generate random PublisherData, two objects must be given: an
    ImpressionGenerator object and a PriceGenerator object.
