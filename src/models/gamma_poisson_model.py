class GammaPoissonModel(ReachCurve):
    """Gamma-Poisson reach curve model for underreported counts.

    The Gamma-Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution defined on the
    non-negative integers.  The probably of observing a count of k is given
    by a Poisson distribution with parameter lambda, where lambda is drawn
    from a Gamma distribution with shape alpha and rate beta.  Explicitly,
       Pr(X = k) = lambda^k e^{-lambda} / k!, where lambda ~ Gamma(alpha, beta),
    k = 0, 1, 2, ...

    The Gamma-Poisson distribution is often used for modeling overdispersed
    data, which is common in the advertising industry.  In this setting, the
    random variable X represents the total number of impressions that could
    potentially be shown to a randomly chosen user.  This quantity is called
    the available inventory for X.

    In the underreported Gamma-Poisson model, we are given a set of
    observed impression counts, one value for each viewer that is
    reached.  Let these values be k_1,k_2,...,k_R.  Thus, R is the
    number of people that were reached, and the number of impressions
    that shown is I = k_1+k_2+...+k_R.  The unknown parameters that
    need to be estimated are:

      * the parameters alpha and beta of the associated Gamma distribution,
      * the total size I_max of the impression inventory, and
      * the total number N of viewers that could potentially be reached.

    This class implements code for estimating these parameters and for
    performing forecasts with those estimates.

    Let f(n | alpha, beta) be the probability that the size of the available
    inventory of a user is n.  Then, the probability that a randomly chosen
    user will have inventory n and be reached k times is given by

       g(k, n | alpha, beta, I, I_max) =
            C(n, k) (I / I_max)^k (1 - I/I_max)^{n-k} f(n | alpha, beta),

    where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient n!/[k!(n-k)!].

    Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen user will be reached
    exactly k times is

       g(k | alpha, beta, I, I_max) =
            sum_{n=k}^{infinity} g(k, n | alpha, beta, I, I_max).

    Thus, if a total of N viewers can potentially be reached, then the expected
    number of people who will be reached k times is

       hbar[i] = N * g(k | alpha, beta, I, I_max).

    Note that the value I is determined from the input and is not a
    model parameter that needs to be fit.  Thus, the apparent number
    of parameters that need to be fit is four.  However, we reduce
    the number of parameters to two as follows.  First, we note that
    the expected value of a Gamma-Poisson distribution with parameters
    alpha and beta is alpha/beta.  Thus, the total number of
    impressions I_max is related to the total number of potential
    viewers N via the relation

      E[I_max] = N * alpha/beta.

    We therefore set N = I_max * beta / alpha.  Next, we note that
    the size of the total impression inventory I_max is essentially
    a free parameter.  In fact, along the line I_max * beta = constant,
    the objective function is nearly constant.  To see this, observe
    that if the available inventory for each user is doubled, then
    the probability that any given user will receive k impressions
    remains essentially constant.  Thus, we set I / I_max to a
    constant value.  This leaves two remaining parameters to optimize,
    alpha and beta.

    To estimate these parameters we use a histogram matching approach.
    That is to say, let h[i] be the number of people that were reached
    i times, and let hbar[i] be the estimated number of people that
    would be reached i times, given alpha, beta and I_max, N.  The
    objective function that we compute is as follows:

      chi2(h, hbar) = \sum_i (h[i] - hbar[i])^2 / hbar[i]

    The perceptive reader might recognize this as the chi-squared
    statistic.  There are a couple advantages to using the chi-squared
    objective function.  First, in practice, the parameter estimates
    that are found often give a nearly exact match to the histograms
    that are observed.  Second, a low value of the objective function
    gives some confidence that a statistically good fit has been
    found.

        The surface represented by the objective function has large flat
        regions, and it often contains a valley with a false minimum that
        is adjacent to the basin containing the true minimum.  However,
        it seems to be the case that the basin containing the true minimum
        is often located relatively close to the origin.  This function performs
        a simple downhill search for a local optimum starting from a point
        close to the origin.  The value returned by this function can then
        be used as the starting point for a more thorough optimization
        attempt.
